JSSRC project is aimed at creating high quality audio resampler written in pure java.

It is based on the SSRC High Quality Audio Sampling Rate Converter (http://shibatch.sourceforge.net/) by Naoki Shibata written in C.
Naohide Sano ported the C code into java.
Finally, a number of small modification were performed in order to have a java resampling service that is easy to use.

You can find some examples of upsampling/downsampling in the test directory
